# 🏭 Amana Industries Activity Assignment

## 📦 What This Repository Covers

This repository documents our work for the **Amana Full Stack Development Bootcamp**. It contains the code and resources used to complete the assignment focused on building interactive chart components with real-world data and AI-powered prototyping.

---

## 📝 Assignment Overview

- We were given a working codebase and API data for Amana Industries factories.
- Our **main task** was to build a chart component that visualizes factory data (like inventory levels and production capacity) using **React** and **Next.js**.
- In this session, we learned how to use an AI model (**Gemini**) to rapidly prototype a React component — from design to code generation!

---

## 🚀 This Week's Journey

### 1️⃣ How AI is Changing Software Engineering

- We discussed how 🤖 AI is reshaping the job market, especially for entry-level roles.
- Key takeaways: **Master AI tools**, **understand architecture**, **build super skills**, **think like a product manager**, and **keep building!** 💡

### 2️⃣ How AI Models Work

- We learned that the **prompts and context** we provide greatly affect the quality of AI-generated code.
- Practiced controlling the output by adjusting our prompts for Gemini.

### 3️⃣ Tools We Used

- 🧠 **Gemini VS Code Extension** for AI-powered coding.
- ⚛️ **Next.js & React.js** for our front-end framework.
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- ☁️ **Vercel** for hosting and serverless functions.

### 4️⃣ Front-End Frameworks Deep Dive

- We explored **component structures**, **templating**, **state management**, and **routing**.
- Saw how modern frameworks like Next.js let us build interactive, data-driven applications.

### 5️⃣ Prototyping with AI

- We leveraged Gemini to **speed up building our chart component**.
- Instead of starting from scratch, we used AI to generate boilerplate code, then adapted it for our needs.

## 📊 API Data We Visualized

Below is a sample of the factory data we worked with:

```json
{
  "factory_data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Amana Textiles Amman",
      "status": "operational",
      "established": "2018",
      "employees": 450,
      "production_capacity_monthly": 850
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Amana Spinning Irbid",
      "status": "operational",
      "established": "2020",
      "employees": 320,
      "production_capacity_monthly": 650,
      "inventory_level_2024": [
        { "month": "January", "value": 677 },
        { "month": "February", "value": 686 },
        { "month": "March", "value": 853 },
        { "month": "April", "value": 835 },
        { "month": "May", "value": 996 },
        { "month": "June", "value": 1149 },
        { "month": "July", "value": 1224 },
        { "month": "August", "value": 1221 },
        { "month": "September", "value": 1169 },
        { "month": "October", "value": 1106 },
        { "month": "November", "value": 1114 },
        { "month": "December", "value": 1291 }
      ],
      "contact": {
        "manager": "Fatima Qasemi",
        "phone": "+962-2-7201945",
        "email": "fatima.qasemi@amana-textiles.com"
      }
    }
    // ...more factories
  ]
}
```

## 🧑‍💻 What We Learned

- **Front-End frameworks** make complex, interactive apps much easier to build and maintain. 🧩
- **AI tools** (like Gemini) supercharge our workflow and help us prototype faster. ⚡
- Building confidence comes from hands-on experience — **the more you build, the better you get!** 🏗️
